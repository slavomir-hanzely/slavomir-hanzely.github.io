In this work, we study ommunication compression and aggregation mechanisms for curvature information in order to reduce these costs while preserving theoretically superior local convergence guarantees. We prove that the recently developed class of three point compressors (3PC) of Richtarik et al. [2022] for gradient communication can be generalized to Hessian communication as well. This result opens up a wide variety of communication strategies, such as contractive compression and lazy aggregation, available to our disposal to compress prohibitively costly curvature information. Moreover, we discovered several new 3PC mechanisms, such as adaptive thresholding and Bernoulli aggregation, which require reduced communication and occasional Hessian computations. Furthermore, we extend and analyze our approach to bidirectional communication compression and partial device participation setups to cater to the practical considerations of applications in federated learning. For all our methods, we derive fast condition-number-independent local linear and/or superlinear convergence rates. Finally, with extensive numerical evaluations on convex optimization problems, we illustrate that our designed schemes achieve state-of-the-art communication complexity compared to several key baselines using second-order information.","tags":["\"cs.LG\"","\"math.OC\""],"title":"Distributed Newton-Type Methods with Communication Compression and Bernoulli Aggregation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Slavom√≠r Hanzely","Dmitry Kamzolov","Dimitry Pasechnyuk","Alexander Gasnikov","Peter Richt√°rik","Martin Tak√°ƒç"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658250454,"objectID":"969910147b848e5e35db1767f46a4475","permalink":"slavomir-hanzely.github.io/publication/hanzely-2022/","publishdate":"2022-07-19T17:07:33.85169Z","relpermalink":"slavomir-hanzely.github.io/publication/hanzely-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we present the first stepsize schedule for Newton method resulting in fast global and local convergence guarantees.

To the best of our knowledge, in this nonconvex finite-sum regime, all existing variance-reduced methods, including SARAH, SVRG, SAGA and their variants, need to compute the full gradient over all $n$ data samples at the initial point $x^0$, and then periodically compute the full gradient once every few iterations (for SVRG, SARAH and their variants). Note that SVRG, SAGA and their variants typically achieve weaker convergence results than variants of SARAH: $n^{2/3}/Œµ^2$ vs. $n^{1/2}/Œµ^2$. Thus we focus on the variant of SARAH. The proposed ZeroSARAH and its distributed variant D-ZeroSARAH are the emphfirst variance-reduced algorithms which emphdo not require any full gradient computations, not even for the initial point. Moreover, for both standard and distributed settings, we show that ZeroSARAH and D-ZeroSARAH obtain new state-of-the-art convergence results, which can improve the previous best-known result (given by e.g., SPIDER, SARAH, and PAGE) in certain regimes. Avoiding any full gradient computations (which are time-consuming steps) is important in many applications as the number of data samples $n$ usually is very large. Especially in the distributed setting, periodic computation of full gradient over all data samples needs to periodically synchronize all clients/devices/machines, which may be impossible or unaffordable. Thus, we expect that ZeroSARAH/D-ZeroSARAH will have a practical impact in distributed and federated learning where full device participation is impractical.","tags":["\"cs.LG\"","\"cs.DC\"","\"math.OC\""],"title":"ZeroSARAH: Efficient Nonconvex Finite-Sum Optimization with Zero Full Gradient Computation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Slavom√≠r Hanzely","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Our second contribution is the design of several optimal methods matching these lower bounds in almost all regimes. These are the first provably optimal methods for personalized federated learning.

However, this formula is of no practical value as it depends on the knowledge of the variance of the stochastic gradients evaluated at the optimum. In this paper we design a practical SGD method capable of learning the optimal mini-batch size adaptively throughout its iterations. Our method does this provably, and in our experiments with synthetic and real data robustly exhibits nearly optimal behaviour; that is, it works as if the optimal mini-batch size was known a-priori. Further, we generalize our method to several new mini-batch strategies not considered in the literature before, including a sampling suitable for distributed implementations.","tags":"","title":"Adaptive Learning of the Optimal Mini-Batch Size of SGD","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne **Two** Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
