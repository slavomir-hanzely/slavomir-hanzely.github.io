To the best of our knowledge, in this nonconvex finite-sum regime, all existing variance-reduced methods, including SARAH, SVRG, SAGA and their variants, need to compute the full gradient over all $n$ data samples at the initial point $x^0$, and then periodically compute the full gradient once every few iterations (for SVRG, SARAH and their variants). Note that SVRG, SAGA and their variants typically achieve weaker convergence results than variants of SARAH: $n^{2/3}/Œµ^2$ vs. $n^{1/2}/Œµ^2$. Thus we focus on the variant of SARAH. The proposed ZeroSARAH and its distributed variant D-ZeroSARAH are the emphfirst variance-reduced algorithms which emphdo not require any full gradient computations, not even for the initial point. Moreover, for both standard and distributed settings, we show that ZeroSARAH and D-ZeroSARAH obtain new state-of-the-art convergence results, which can improve the previous best-known result (given by e.g., SPIDER, SARAH, and PAGE) in certain regimes. Avoiding any full gradient computations (which are time-consuming steps) is important in many applications as the number of data samples $n$ usually is very large. Especially in the distributed setting, periodic computation of full gradient over all data samples needs to periodically synchronize all clients/devices/machines, which may be impossible or unaffordable. Thus, we expect that ZeroSARAH/D-ZeroSARAH will have a practical impact in distributed and federated learning where full device participation is impractical.","tags":["\"cs.LG\"","\"cs.DC\"","\"math.OC\""],"title":"ZeroSARAH: Efficient Nonconvex Finite-Sum Optimization with Zero Full Gradient Computation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Slavom√≠r Hanzely","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Our first contribution is establishing the first lower bounds for this formulation, for both the communication complexity and the local oracle complexity. Our second contribution is the design of several optimal methods matching these lower bounds in almost all regimes. These are the first provably optimal methods for personalized federated learning. Our optimal methods include an accelerated variant of FedProx, and an accelerated variance-reduced version of FedAvg/Local SGD. We demonstrate the practical superiority of our methods through extensive numerical experiments.","tags":"","title":"Lower Bounds and Optimal Algorithms for Personalized Federated Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Motasem Alfarra","Slavom√≠r Hanzely","Alyazeed Albasyoni","Bernard Ghanem","Peter Richt√°rik"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621350601,"objectID":"82a6515aff191bd0c5d5becbb6388734","permalink":"/publication/alfarra-2020/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alfarra-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent advances in the theoretical understandingof SGD (Gower et al., 2019) led to a formula for the optimal mini-batch size minimizing the number of effective data passes, i.e., the number of iterations times the mini-batch size. However, this formula is of no practical value as it depends on the knowledge of the variance of the stochastic gradients evaluated at the optimum. In this paper we design a practical SGD method capable of learning the optimal mini-batch size adaptively throughout its iterations. Our method does this provably, and in our experiments with synthetic and real data robustly exhibits nearly optimal behaviour; that is, it works as if the optimal mini-batch size was known a-priori. Further, we generalize our method to several new mini-batch strategies not considered in the literature before, including a sampling suitable for distributed implementations.","tags":"","title":"Adaptive Learning of the Optimal Mini-Batch Size of SGD","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
